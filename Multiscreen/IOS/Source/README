SDK-DIAL-CLIENT-IOS

== INTRODUCTION ==

This is the SmartTV Alliance SDK 2.5 DIAL iOS Client application. It was
developed according to the DIAL protocol specification 1.6.4
(http://www.dial-multiscreen.org/).

Its objective is to serve as a testing client for DIAL service implementation
as well as a sample code for DIAL client implementations (for iOS).
It uses upnpx library for doing DIAL services discovery via UPnP's SSDP
protocol, as specified by DIAL.

== USAGE ==

The application is composed of 2 screens. The first one is presented when it is
opened and should list the services found in the network.
There is a 'Refresh' button on the top right corner in case the user wants to
force another DIAL service's search.

Upon clicking on one of the listed services, the user is taken to another
screen. At this one, it is possible to send the DIAL requests to the selected
service. To do it, just type the name of the application and click on the
corresponding button for the desired action.
When sending the 'Start' request, the user can also add arguments filling
the indicated text field.

When performing the requests and reading the responses, the application
will print information about the progress and data to the screen.

== BUILDING AND DEPLOYING ==

sdk-dial-client-ios already ships upnpx's source code to make building easier.
To build the project, double click the .xcworkspace file. It should open
XCode. Check that the DialApp target is enabled on the top left corner, besides
the Run and Stop buttons. Then, go to "Product -> Build" on the menu bar
and it should build both upnpx sources and then the Dial App.

Deploying should be done just like any other iOS application, it can be done
both to the simulator or an iOS device. Simply set the iOS targeted device or
simulator in XCode and click 'Run'. Note that in order to deploy applications
to an iOS device the developer should be enrolled in the Apple's iOS
developer program. More instructions can be found at
